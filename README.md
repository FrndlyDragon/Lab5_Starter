## Lab Questions
1. No since this would be complex with many parts working together (clientside with both users creating their messages, network to send those messages, and client again to receive messages).
2. Yes since this would only test one aspect of a part of the feature/application that doesn't need to communicate with other parts of the application. One could simply make a case to judge the character limit easily.
